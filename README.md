# Community-Detection-Algorithms-Performance-comparison
The implementation was done using python networkx and matplot libraries. Zachary karate club dataset is used as a benchmark dataset between the different community  detection algorithms. Karate is the well-known and much-used dataset to benchmark algorithms as  ground truth of it is two so if a detection algorithm is close to these two sets, then it is most likely to  be accurate at detection. The data was collected from the members of a university karate club by  Wayne Zachary in 1977. Each node represents a member of the club, and each edge represents a  tie between two members of the club. The network is undirected. The network captures 34 members  of a karate club, documenting links between pairs of members who interacted outside the club.  During the study a conflict arose between the administrator "John A" and instructor "Mr. Hi", which  led to the split of the club into two. Half of the members formed a new club around Mr. Hi; members  from the other part found a new instructor or gave up karate. Based on collected data Zachary  correctly assigned all but one member of the club to the groups they joined after the split.
